    """Trains and tests a PyTorch model.

    Passes a target PyTorch models through train_step() and test_step()
    functions for a number of epochs, training and testing the model
    in the same epoch loop.

    Calculates, prints and stores evaluation metrics throughout.

    Args:
    model: A PyTorch model to be trained and tested.
    train_dataloader: A DataLoader instance for the model to be trained on.
    test_dataloader: A DataLoader instance for the model to be tested on.
    optimizer: A PyTorch optimizer to help minimize the loss function.
    loss_fn: A PyTorch loss function to calculate loss on both datasets.
    epochs: An integer indicating how many epochs to train for.
    device: A target device to compute on (e.g. "cuda" or "cpu").

    Returns:
    A dictionary of training and testing loss as well as training and
    testing accuracy metrics. Each metric has a value in a list for 
    each epoch.
    In the form: {train_loss: [...],
              train_acc: [...],
              test_loss: [...],
              test_acc: [...]}
